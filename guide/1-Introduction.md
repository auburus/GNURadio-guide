# Introduction

Welcome to this tutorial series. As users of GNURadio we have experienced
different kind of problems unitl we have "learned" it (notice the quotes...).
Most of the time, we find that the problem is kind of the lack of specific
documentation for the problem we are dealing with. That's our reason for
writting this Guide.

### Prerequisites
As the GNURadio website says, a general knowledge of Signal Processing is
mandatory to use GNUadio
